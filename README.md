## Final Report Components

### Project Introduction
- One sentence "sound bite" that describes your project.
- A summary of what you did and why.

### High level design
- Rationale and sources of your project idea

The rationale of this math $asd$

- background math
- logical structure
- hardware/software tradeoffs
- Discuss existing patents, copyrights, and trademarks which are relevant to your project.

### Program/hardware design
- program details. What parts were tricky to write?
- hardware details. Could someone else build this based on what you have written?
- Be sure to specifically reference any design or code you used from someone else.
- Things you tried which did not work

### Results of the design
- Any and all test data, scope traces, waveforms, etc
- speed of execution (hesitation, filcker, interactiveness, concurrency)
- accuracy (numeric, music frequencies, video signal timing, etc)
- how you enforced safety in the design.
- usability by you and other people

### Conclusions
- Analyse your design in terms of how the results met your expectations. What might you do differently next time?
- How did your design conform to the applicable standards?
- Intellectual property considerations.
    - Did you reuse code or someone else's design? Did you use any of Altera's IP?
    - Did you use code in the public domain?
    - Are you reverse-engineering a design? How did you deal with patent/trademark issues?
    - Did you have to sign non-disclosure to get a sample part?
    - Are there patent opportunites for your project?

### Appendix A (permissions)
- "The group approves this report for inclusion on the course website."
- "The group approves the video for inclusion on the course youtube channel."

### Additional appendices
- Appendix with commented Verilog and/or program listings.
- Appendix with schematics if you build hardware external to the DE1-SoC board (you can download free software from expresspcb.com to draw schematics).
- Appendix with a list of the specific tasks in the project carried out by each team member.
- References you used:
    - Data sheets
    - Vendor sites
    - Code/designs borrowed from others
    - Background sites/paper
